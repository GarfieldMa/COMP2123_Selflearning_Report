# Solving the Minimum-Spanning-Tree Problem with Prim’s Algorithm
## Objectives
Today there’s gonna be something exciting to learn and at the end of day, you shall be able to:
- Understand what is the *Minimum-Spanning-Tree Problem*
- Know what is *Prim’s Algorithm* and how to implement it
- Understand how Prim’s Algorthim could be used to solve the minimum-spanning-tree problem

## Motivations
*”So what is a minimum-spanning-tree problem anyways?”*
Great question! In simple words, it is about finding a set of shortest possible edges of a *connected*, *edge-weighted* and *undirected* graph that connects all the vertices together without cycles. OK that’s quite a lot of information and really not simple I admit, but if you take a closer look it’s actually pretty simple and logical:

First the graph is …
- Connected: //TODO
- Edge-Weighted: //TODO
- Undirected: //TODO

… and what we are looking for from the graph is … 
- A set of edges
- Shortest-possible: //TODO
- Connects all vertices together
- Without cycles

And that’s it!
*”But how do we find that though?”*
Great question again, then here comes our main guest today - **Prim’s Algorithm**!
