# Solving the Minimum-Spanning-Tree Problem with Prim’s Algorithm
## Objectives
Today there’s gonna be something exciting to learn and at the end of day, you shall be able to:
- Understand what is the *Minimum-Spanning-Tree Problem*
- Know what is *Prim’s Algorithm* and how to implement it
- Understand how Prim’s Algorthim could be used to solve the minimum-spanning-tree problem

## Motivations
*”So what is a minimum-spanning-tree problem anyways?”*
Great question! In simple words, it is about finding a set of shortest possible edges of a *connected*, *edge-weighted* and *undirected* graph that connects all the vertices together without cycles. OK that’s quite a lot of information and really not simple I admit, but if you take a closer look it’s actually pretty simple and logical:

First the graph is 
…

- Connected: //TODO

![](resources/connected_graph.png! )

- Edge-Weighted: //TODO
- Undirected: //TODO

… and what we are looking for from the graph is … 
- A set of edges
- Shortest-possible: //TODO
- Connects all vertices together
- Without cycles


And that’s it!
*”But how do we find that though?”*
Great question again, then here comes our main guest today - **Prim’s Algorithm**!

## What is Prim’s Algorithm About?
In simple words, … 

… a pseudo code of this algorithm would be like this:
```
/* insert ADAPTED pseudocode here */
```

### Your Trusty Data Structure - Graph
But how can we do this in C++? First we need to have  a data structure for modeling a *graph*. A graph is …, and as this is not the main focus of today’s self learning, we have provided a `Graph.h` file which contains a basic implementation of the a Graph data structure! In this implementation we used *adjacency list* to model a graph, to find out more about it, you can visit [XXXXXX](LINK_TO_BE_CHANGED!!!). For today, you only need to know our `Graph.h` contains the following methods that you could make use of when implementing our algorithm:

- `addVertex()` which adds XXXX
- `and some other stuff`
- …
 
And now you are equipped with our weapon and shield, we can finally go on our conquest to find our *Minimum-Spanning-Tree*!

## Let’s Do It!
First we gonna grab ‘em by the p*ssy by declaring … to be continued.
